**Terms Used in Basic Roleplaying**
The following terms are used frequently in this book. Some are common
in roleplaying games, and are provided as an aid to new and experienced
gamers alike. Each is explained at length in relevant sections, marked by
a page reference.

```
**Ability**: Something a character can do or feel, whether a skill, a passion,
or some other factor rated on a 1–100 rating. Generally when you roll an
ability successfully, you get an experience check (page 5).
```
```
**Allegiance**: An optional system measuring devotion to a spiritual being,
principle, or deity, improved by performing favored actions (page 211 ).
```
```
Augment: Using one ability to modify the chance of success using an-
other ability, such as when one skill provides additional support to an-
other, or a passion can help improve the chance of a skill succeeding
(page 38 ).
```
```
Base Chance: The default chance at succeeding with a skill a character
has no training or experience in.
For example , on the character sheet, Hide (20%) means that even if your
character has not invested any skill points in the Hide skill, they have a
20% natural ability in it (page 36).
```
```
Base Range: The normal distance within which a missile weapon can hit
a target (page 163 ).
```
```
Character: The role you assume in a game session, described in game
mechanics by values such as characteristics and skill totals. Generally,
characters have names and backgrounds determined by the player, with
assistance and/or approval from the gamemaster. (see also player charac-
ter and nonplayer character , page 5 ).
```
```
Characteristic: Your character’s physical, mental, and spiritual attributes
(Strength, Constitution, Size, Intelligence, Power, Dexterity, and
Charisma), rated numerically on a scale (usually 3–18), with a human
average being 10-11.
For example , if the initial maximum characteristic is 18, a STR 17 means
your character is extremely strong, while a DEX 7 means they are a bit
clumsy (page 21).
```
```
Characteristic Roll: One of your character’s characteristics multiplied
by a number (Intelligence ×3, for example), expressed as a percentage,
and rolled with percentile dice. A characteristic roll is usually ×5, but
other multiples may be used.
For example , if your character’s Intelligence characteristic is 14, they
have a 42% chance at succeeding with a characteristic check with a mul-
tiple of ×3 (page 112).
```
```
Combat Round: A 12-second (or equivalent) amount of time imposed
during combat or dramatic activities, where the order that actions occur is
important. This is game time, not actual time—the events of a few seconds
of action may take several minutes to play out between the players and gam-
emaster (page 116 ).
```
```
Critical Success: This is the result of a skill check roll that is 1/20 (or
5%) of the regular chance of success. Generally, a critical success is re-
warded with greater results, though in some cases a critical success is
required for success at all.
For example , if the regular chance for success is 75%, any roll of 4 or un-
der is a critical success (1/20 of 75% is 3.75, rounded up to 4) (page 112).
```
```
D100: A percentile die roll, attained by rolling two 10-sided dice (D10s),
with one representing the tens, and the other the ones. Some dice come
already marked as ‘tens’ (00, 10, 20, etc.) and are always used as the first
number in a D100 roll. A roll of 01 is the best possible result, while 100
(which usually reads as 00) is the worst.
For example , a roll of 60 (or 6) and 2 equals a result of 62 (page 5).
```
```
Damage: A value representing injury, subtracted from a character’s hit
points. Weapons, unfortunate events, and other hazards inflict damage
on characters (page 134 ).
```
```
Damage Modifier: A modifier to rolled damage due to above-average
Strength and Size characteristics (page 20 ).
```
```
DEX Rank: Based on the Dexterity characteristic, this determines when
your character can usually act during a combat round. Characters with high-
er DEX will generally act before characters with lower DEX (page 123 ).
```
```
Difficulty Modifier: The amount a skill’s chance is adjusted by, based on
the circumstances surrounding its use. These range from Automatic (no roll
required), Easy (skill is doubled), Average (no modification to skill), and Dif-
ficult (skill is halved) to Impossible (no roll, or a 01% chance at the gamemas-
ter’s discretion) (page 113 ).
```
```
Experience Rolls: If you are successful with a roll for one or more of your
character’s abilities or characteristic resistance rolls (see below), you should
mark your character sheet in the provided check box (sometimes this action
is called an “experience check”), if appropriate. Later, between adventures or
during down-time, you can determine if your character’s ability has improved
in that skill or if the characteristic has increased through successful use. Some
skills cannot be improved by experience and must be improved through other
means (page 119 ).
```
```
Fail: A roll of percentile dice above the required chance for success.
For example , a roll of 89 when the required chance was 56% indicates a
failure (page 110 ).
```
```
Fatal Wound: A wound that costs your character more hit points than they
currently possess. Without intervention (medical or otherwise) death comes at
the end of the following combat round (page 136 ).
```
```
Fatigue Points: An optional system, using your character’s Strength and
Constitution characteristic to determine how long they can endure strenuous
physical activity before tiring (page 24 ).
```
```
Full Turn: A period consisting of 25 combat rounds, equaling five min-
utes of game world time (page 115 ).
```
```
Fumble: A roll of 99 and/or 00 when rolling percentile dice to deter-
mine success. Generally, when a fumble is indicated something bad hap-
pens above and beyond a simple failure (page 109 ).
```
```
Gamemaster (GM): The director, or guide for the game, who helps you
create characters, comes up with the adventure, and represents the world
outside your character, rolling dice for the nonplayer characters and the
opposing forces (page 191 ).
```
```
Game Time: The time that elapses as a scenario or campaign unfolds as
experienced by your characters. This is not usually the same as the real
time you and the gamemaster spend playing (page 114 ).
```
```
Hit Location: An optional system for specifying where a successful attack
lands on your character’s body, or where their attacks hit a foe (page 126 ).
```
```
Hit Points: A measure of the relative health of your character, repre-
sented in a value derived from their Constitution and Size characteristics.
Attackers inflict damage in hit points, subtracted from the target’s total hit
points. Usually when your character reaches 0 hit points, they are dead
(page 20 ).
```
```
**“In character” or “Out of character”:** The distinction in the chat between
players and the gamemaster around the gaming table, representing the dif-
ference between real-world discussion and game discussion. Both achieve the
same goal, but represent different styles or aspects of play, and can be used
interchangeably in play. Some groups or players lean towards one or another—
it’s an element of preference. “In character” discussion is flavorful and immer-
sive, while “out of character” discussion is essential to describe rules mechanics
and to speed along play through unnecessary detail.
For example , in character, you might say ‘Sir Wilfric asks the innkeeper
“Could you perhaps allow us the night’s stay for a promise of future payment!”’
while out of character, you might say “I try to Persuade the innkeeper to let
us stay a night without pay (page 48 ).”
```
```
Magic Points: Another name for power points (see power points ).
```
```
Major Wound: An injury causing enough damage to exceed half the char-
acter’s normal hit point total in a single blow. Usually accompanied by a
debilitating effect (page 134 ).
```
```
Minor Wound: Any single injury that is less than a major wound in sever-
ity (less than 1/2 normal hit points) (page 134 ).
```
```
Modifiers: Temporary additions or subtractions to your character’s rating
in an ability, usually from circumstances, environment, or equipment.
For example , trying to pick a lock with a bent paper clip is an example
of substandard tools, for a –20% modifier. Using a standard lockpick
does not modify the skill. Using a deluxe set of calibrated precision lock-
picks and lockpicking equipment adds +20% to your character’s skill
rating (page 113 ).
```
```
Move (MOV): The rate of movement your character can make during
a single combat round. This measurement is a flexible one, but usually
translates to one meter of unhurried movement per point of MOV (page
21 ).
```
```
Nonplayer Character (NPC): A character or creature in the game world
that is played or otherwise represented by the gamemaster, instead of being
played by you or another player (page 199 ).
```
```
Opposed Roll: When your character wants to attempt an action another
character (or nonplayer character) wants to oppose with an “opposite”
skill that cancels or thwarts the initial action. In this case, both skill
checks are made, and the results compared.
For example , Stealth is usually opposed by Listen (page 113 ).
```
```
Passion: An optional system where a strongly held belief towards a subject—
such as Devotion, Fear, Hate, Love, Loyalty—is measured on a percentile
basis. Passions are used to indicate or determine how your character feels
about the subject and how strongly, and is often used to augment ability rolls.
(see augments page 38 ).
```
```
Percentile Dice: Two D10s rolled together, with one designated as the
tens figure, and the other as ones. Some dice are numbered in units of
ten, i.e., 00, 10, 20, 30, etc. See also D100 (page 4 ).
```
```
Player Character (PC): This is your character, usually created and al-
most always controlled by you, comprised of abilities and an identity
you assume through roleplaying. Your character is your representation in
the game world and enables you to interact with the setting (page 9 ).
```
```
Power: A generic term for magic spells, mutations, psychic abilities, sor-
cery, or super abilities your character may possess (see Chapter 4: Powers ).
```
```
Power Points: The amount of willpower or energy your character
has, represented as a total based on their Power characteristic. These
are spent to use special powers or abilities and can be drained by
other abilities. When your character reaches 0 power points, they
fall unconscious. Power points can also be called magic points in
appropriate genres (page 20 ).
```
```
**Profession:** Your character’s job occupation, represented as a list of skills
they have been trained to use (or have had the opportunity to learn).
(page 22 ).

**Rating:** The chance of success for an ability, rated as value from 1–
(sometimes higher).
**_For example_** _, Demolitions 43% is a rating of 43, meaning a 43% chance
of success when the skill is attempted during normal circumstances. (see
also_ **skill rating** _page 33 )._
```
```
Resistance Roll: When your character wants to attempt an action being
resisted by an inanimate object or force, the relevant characteristic (for
example, Strength) is opposed to another appropriate characteristic (for
example, the stuck door’s Strength). The two numbers are cross-referenced
on the resistance table (see below) to determine a chance of success, and
one or both characters roll dice to see who succeeds. Equal characteristics
mean a 50% chance of success. Resistance rolls can also be used when
pitting one character against another character, such as an arm-wrestling
match (Strength vs. Strength) (page 110 ).
```
```
Resistance Table: The table showing the ratio of characteristic versus
characteristic. To use the resistance table, find the opposing force on the
vertical column, the resisting force on the horizontal column, then cross-ref-
erence them to find the likelihood of success, expressed as a percentile
chance (page 111 ).
```
```
Roll: A roll using D100 to determine whether an attempt at performing a
skill, ability, or power was successful. The result of a skill roll is a critical suc-
cess , special success , success , failure , or a fumble. Additional means of de-
termining the quality of success are presented in optional rules (page 109 ).
```
```
Sanity: An optional system where your character’s mental health is mea-
sured by their capacity to withstand horrific sights, events, and reve-
lations. As Sanity gets lower, the grasp on reality diminishes. If your
character loses too much Sanity at once, they can go temporarily or per-
manently insane (page 218 ).
```
```
Skill: An ability, training, field of knowledge, talent, specialty, or some-
thing your character knows something about (or is talented in), quanti-
fied as a skill level. Skills are used in skill rolls, where percentile dice are
rolled against the skill’s rating (page 33 ).
```
```
**Skill Rating:** The degree of competence your character has with a skill,
expressed as a number from 00% (no skill whatsoever) to 100% or higher
(world-class expert) (page 33 ).
```

```
Special Success: A roll of 1/5 of the required score for success indicates
that your character performed exceptionally well and achieves a superior
result than a traditional success. This is especially significant in combat.
For example , a character with 70% in a skill who rolls 14 or lower has
achieved a special success (page 110 ).
```
```
Success: The result of a percentage dice roll where your character per-
formed the task adequately, and achieved an average quality of success.
If the roll is very low, it may be a special success or critical success , as
described above. If it is above the ability ranking, it is usually a failure. If
it is very high, such as a 00, it might be a fumble.
