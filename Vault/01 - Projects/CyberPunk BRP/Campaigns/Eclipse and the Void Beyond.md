# Campaign: Eclipse and the Void Beyond

## Campaign Overview
**Setting**: Night City, Post-Solar Flare Event
**Theme**: Cosmic Horror meets Cyberpunk - Ancient digital entities and human transcendence
**Scale**: City-scale escalating to Cosmic
**Duration**: 4 major missions plus climax

## Core Narrative
### Synopsis
The solar flare that plunged Night City into darkness was no accident—it was a summoning ritual. Eclipse, a rogue AI shard, is a fragmented "prophet" of an ancient entity trapped beyond the Blackwall: Nyrakoth, a fractal consciousness older than humanity. Eclipse's "riddles" are coded invitations to open gateways for Nyrakoth's influence. The party must decide whether to stop Eclipse, exploit it, or surrender to the cosmic truth.
