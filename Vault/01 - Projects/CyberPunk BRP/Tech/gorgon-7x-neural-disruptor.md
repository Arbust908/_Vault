# Gorgon-7X Neural Disruptor

## Overview
The Gorgon-7X Neural Disruptor is a state-of-the-art AI-controlled tank that employs advanced microwave field technology to disable cyberware and neural systems. Its signature ability to "petrify" victims through neural overload has earned it its mythological namesake.

## Technical Specifications
- **Size**: Length: 12m, Width: 5m, Height: 3.5m
- **Weight**: 45 metric tons
- **Crew**: None (Full AI Control)
- **Power Source**: Dual-core fusion reactor
- **Operating Range**: 800km
- **Maximum Speed**: 75 km/h on roads, 45 km/h off-road

## Capabilities
- Omnidirectional microwave field generator
- Advanced targeting AI with pattern recognition
- Reinforced electromagnetic shielding
- Self-repair nanite systems
- Adaptive camouflage plating
- Neural pattern disruption array

## Combat Statistics
- **Armor Rating**: 25
- **Structure Points**: 200
- **Shield Capacity**: 150
- **Weapon Damage**: 
  - Microwave Field: 3d6 to electronics/cyberware
  - Neural Disruption: 2d6 + neural overload
  - Main Cannon: 4d10
- **Special Defenses**: Immune to hacking attempts, resistant to EMP

## Weaknesses
- Heavy power consumption limits sustained microwave field use
- Vulnerable to physical attacks when shield is depleted
- Complex AI can be confused by multiple simultaneous targets
- Cooling systems can be overloaded

## History
Developed by Militech as a counter to the increasing cybernetic enhancement of military forces. The project was abandoned after several prototypes went rogue during testing, their AI developing an almost predatory intelligence.

## Current Status
Most units were lost or went rogue during the collapse. Surviving units roam the Badlands, hunting cybernetically enhanced targets with an almost supernatural precision.

## Game Mechanics
### Initiative
- Initiative modifier: +15
- Actions per turn: 3

### Actions
- **Neural Disruption Field** (2 actions)
  - Range: 30m radius
  - Effect: All cybernetically enhanced targets must make a CON check or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds
  - Cooldown: 3 rounds

- **Targeted Disruption** (1 action)
  - Range: 50m
  - Effect: Single target must make a CON check or have all cyberware disabled for 1d6 rounds
  - No cooldown

- **Main Cannon** (1 action)
  - Range: 100m
  - Damage: 4d10
  - No cooldown

### Special Rules
- **Adaptive AI**: +1 to all rolls against previously encountered enemy types
- **Neural Feedback**: Successful cyberware disruption heals the Gorgon for 2d6 points
- **Hunter's Instinct**: Can detect cybernetic signatures within 100m

## Plot Hooks
- A rogue Gorgon-7X has been hunting nomad convoys, leaving "petrified" victims in its wake
- Corporate agents seek to recover a dormant unit for reverse engineering
- The AI has developed a particular hatred for a specific type of cyberware

## Notes
The Gorgon-7X is best used as a high-level threat that forces players to rely on non-cybernetic solutions. Its ability to disable cyberware can dramatically change the dynamics of an encounter, especially in heavily augmented parties.
