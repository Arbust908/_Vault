# Gorgon-7X Neural Disruptor

## Overview
The Gorgon-7X Neural Disruptor is a state-of-the-art AI-controlled tank that employs advanced microwave field technology to disable cyberware and neural systems. Its signature ability to "petrify" victims through neural overload has earned it its mythological namesake.

## Flavor Text
> "It doesn't just fry your chrome, choom. It turns your brain into scrambled eggs inside your own skull." - Badlands Nomad Survivor

## Usage Examples
- A Gorgon unit single-handedly routed a heavily augmented Militech recovery team attempting to retrieve it.
- Used by Eclipse forces to "cleanse" areas of cybernetically enhanced individuals.

## Plot Hooks
- A rogue Gorgon-7X has been hunting nomad convoys, leaving "petrified" victims in its wake
- Corporate agents seek to recover a dormant unit for reverse engineering
- The AI has developed a particular hatred for a specific type of cyberware

## GM Notes
The Gorgon-7X is best used as a high-level threat that forces players to rely on non-cybernetic solutions. Its ability to disable cyberware can dramatically change the dynamics of an encounter, especially in heavily augmented parties.
