A Nomad clan discovers a buried Leviathan Dreadnought in the Badlands, but its AI refuses to obey non-military personnel.

### Rogue AI
The Arachne Webspinner network goes haywire, transforming Watson into a death trap of autonomous turrets.

### Corpo Espionage
Militech hires the party to steal Phoenix Mk. VI blueprints from Night Corp's labs.

### War Crimes
A Tiamat Bio-Chem Crawler stolen by scavengers leaks a biotoxin in Pacifica, causing a quarantine.

A tech-worshiping gang modifies themselves to "bond" with the Fenrir Cyberhounds, becoming feral cyber-liches.

## Battlefield Notes

> "The Banshee's shriek isn't sound—it's a data-stream scream that turns your optics to static."

> "They call it the Basilisk… one glance from its targeting cam, and your synapses stop."

> "The Jörmungandr doesn't attack you. It attacks the ground beneath you."

## Usage Notes
These machines are rare, terrifying forces that even corps fear—perfect for high-stakes missions or post-apocalyptic dungeon crawls through abandoned mil-tech facilities.
