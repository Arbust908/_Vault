# Product Context

## Purpose
This Obsidian vault template exists to provide users with a pre-configured, well-structured environment for personal knowledge management. It addresses the common challenge of starting with a blank vault by providing a thoughtful organization system. Currently, it serves as the development environment for a CyberPunk Basic Role Playing (BRP) TTRPG project, demonstrating how the vault can be used for complex creative projects.

## Problems Solved
1. **Initial Setup Friction**: Eliminates the barrier of setting up a new vault from scratch
2. **Organization Confusion**: Provides clear categories for different types of notes
3. **Consistency Issues**: Includes templates for standardized note creation
4. **Navigation Complexity**: Implements a clear hierarchical structure
5. **TTRPG Development Challenges**: 
   - Organizes complex game mechanics and settings
   - Manages character and NPC information
   - Tracks world-building elements
   - Maintains session notes and campaign progress

## Intended Workflow
1. Users start with this template as their vault foundation
2. Daily notes capture ongoing thoughts and activities
3. Fleeting notes store quick captures and temporary information
4. Important information gets processed into permanent notes
5. Projects and areas maintain focused workspaces
6. Resources collect reference materials
7. Archives store older, less relevant content

### TTRPG Project Workflow
1. **Game Development**:
   - Design core mechanics in Projects

## User Experience Goals

- **Scalable Structure**: Room for growth without reorganization
- **Quick Capture**: Easy entry points for new information
- **Progressive Organization**: Path from fleeting to permanent notes
